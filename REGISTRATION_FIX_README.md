# Registration Fix for QuickCourt

## Problem
The registration was failing with the error: "Registration failed. The email may already be in use or there was a server error. Please try a different email or contact support."

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a missing Row Level Security (RLS) policy in the Supabase database. The `users` table had RLS enabled but was missing a policy that allows users to INSERT their own profile during registration.

## Solution

### 1. Apply Database Fix
Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add the missing RLS policy that allows users to insert their own profile during registration
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile" ON users
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = id::text);
```

You can also run the complete fix script: `fix_registration_issues.sql`

### 2. Code Changes Made

#### AuthContext.tsx
- Improved error handling to provide more specific error messages
- Changed from returning `false` to throwing specific error messages
- Added better error categorization (duplicate email, weak password, etc.)

#### RegisterPage.tsx
- Updated error handling to display specific error messages
- Removed generic error messages in favor of specific ones

### 3. Testing the Fix

1. **Database Test**: Run the verification query in Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'users' 
ORDER BY policyname;
```

2. **Frontend Test**: 
   - Go to the registration page
   - Try registering with a new email address
   - Verify that registration completes successfully
   - Check that you can log in with the new account

3. **Error Handling Test**:
   - Try registering with an existing email
   - Verify you get a specific error message about the email already existing
   - Try registering with a weak password
   - Verify you get a specific error about password strength

## Files Modified
- `database_schema_update.sql` - Added missing RLS policy
- `fix_registration_issues.sql` - Created fix script
- `client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Improved error handling
- `client/src/pages/auth/RegisterPage.tsx` - Updated error display
- `test_registration_fix.js` - Created test script
- `REGISTRATION_FIX_README.md` - This documentation

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- New users can register successfully
- Clear, specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Proper user creation in both Supabase Auth and the users table
- Seamless login after registration

## Troubleshooting
If registration still fails after applying the fix:

1. Check that the RLS policy was created successfully
2. Verify that the users table has the correct structure
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Verify Supabase environment variables are correct
5. Check Supabase logs for any server-side errors

## Security Note
The added RLS policy only allows users to insert their own profile (where `auth.uid()` matches the `id` being inserted). This maintains security while enabling registration functionality.
