-- TEST BOOKING SYSTEM
-- This script tests the booking system functionality
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor

SELECT '=== TESTING FACILITIES QUERY ===' as info;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_facilities,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active_facilities
FROM facilities;

-- 2. Test if we can query time slots
SELECT '=== TESTING TIME SLOTS QUERY ===' as info;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_time_slots,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN is_available = true THEN 1 END) as available_slots
FROM facility_schedules;

-- 3. Test if we can query bookings
SELECT '=== TESTING BOOKINGS QUERY ===' as info;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_bookings,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'pending' THEN 1 END) as pending_bookings,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'approved' THEN 1 END) as approved_bookings
FROM bookings;

-- 4. Test if we can query users
SELECT '=== TESTING USERS QUERY ===' as info;
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_users,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN role = 'customer' THEN 1 END) as customers,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN role = 'facility_owner' THEN 1 END) as facility_owners
FROM users;

-- 5. Test a complete booking query (what the frontend would do)
SELECT '=== TESTING COMPLETE BOOKING QUERY ===' as info;
SELECT 
    b.id as booking_id,
    b.booking_date,
    b.start_time,
    b.end_time,
    b.total_amount,
    b.status,
    f.name as facility_name,
    f.facility_type,
    u.full_name as customer_name,
    u.email as customer_email
FROM bookings b
JOIN facilities f ON b.facility_id = f.id
JOIN users u ON b.customer_id = u.id
LIMIT 5;

-- 6. Test time slots for a specific facility
SELECT '=== TESTING TIME SLOTS FOR FACILITY ===' as info;
SELECT 
    fs.id,
    fs.day_of_week,
    fs.start_time,
    fs.end_time,
    fs.price_per_hour,
    fs.is_available,
    f.name as facility_name
FROM facility_schedules fs
JOIN facilities f ON fs.facility_id = f.id
WHERE f.status = 'active'
LIMIT 10;

-- 7. Test RLS policies are working
SELECT '=== TESTING RLS POLICIES ===' as info;
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('bookings', 'facility_schedules', 'booking_notifications')
AND schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- 8. Test if we can create a sample booking (this should work with proper auth)
SELECT '=== TESTING BOOKING CREATION ===' as info;
-- Note: This would require proper authentication context
-- For now, just check if the table structure allows it
SELECT 
    'Bookings table structure is ready for insertions' as status,
    COUNT(*) as existing_bookings
FROM bookings;

-- 9. Summary
SELECT '=== BOOKING SYSTEM TEST SUMMARY ===' as info;
SELECT 
    'All tests completed successfully!' as message,
